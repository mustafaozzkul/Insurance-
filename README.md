# Insurance Data Analysis

## Project Background

The Insurance Data Analysis Project is a comprehensive Excel-based exploration of customer and policy data in the insurance industry. This project aims to uncover key insights that can support data-driven decision-making for optimizing policy management, and overall business performance.

The analysis leverages Excel features such as formulas, charts, pivot tables, and dashboard visualizations to present findings in a clear and engaging way.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Customer Analysis: Evaluation of total customer volume, gender distribution, and age demographics to identify key customer segments and behavioral patterns.
- City Performance: Evaluation of premium distribution by city to identify top-performing locations with the highest total premium values.
- Claim Analysis: Evaluation of claim reasons to understand the most common causes for insurance claims and identify patterns in customer behavior.
- Premium Analysis: Evaluation of premium tiers and their distribution to understand the frequency and popularity of different premium levels.
